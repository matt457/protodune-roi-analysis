# protodune-roi-analysis

Root and python scripts to analyze ROI efficiency on protodune data

First run wct on raw data   
Then run roi_data_parser.C on the root output   
Then run Track Detection.ipynb to get efficiency   
Also run roi_bin_inclusion.C to compare roi efficiency with amount of data kept
